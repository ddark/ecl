+Original Script by: ain't got a clue.
+Rewritten and made better by: LordPsyan
+
+Fake players does exactly what the name suggests.. creates fake players for your realm.
+
+When a player clicks the "who" list, it will grab all players that are online, and then fill
+the rest with fake players from the `characters_fake` table until it shows 49. Any time a
+player logs in, it will remove a fake player, and replace it with the real online player. If
+a player logs out, it will remove that player from the list, and replace it with a fake one.
+
+This is a good thing for low population realms. It makes the realm look more populated.
+
+Currently, if you try to whisper a "fake" player, a message will appear saying they do not wish
+to be disturbed. This message currently comes up in red at top center of screen. 
+
+TODO:
+
+1. Fix location of message.
+2. Fix bug that posts the "do not disturb" message if you try to whisper someone who is offline.
+3. Set config option to have the Do Not Disturb Message on or off. 
+4. Set config file with custom Do Not Disturb message.
+5. GM command instead of config file option, to turn on or off the fake players.
+
+INSTALL:
+
+1). apply the patch to the core.
+
+2). Run the sql file (comes with 49 fake players, so you don't have to make your own) in your
+characters database.
+
+3). Set the config option to 1 or 0 to turn it on or off. You can modify the config file while
+server is running, and do .reload config to turn the fake players on or off.

+NPC Teleport for Trinity
+
+Original author : Wilibald09
+Script Modified by: LordPsyan
+
+Allows you to add a custom NPC for teleporting, using .npc add 100000.
+The default NPC is entry 100000.
+
+All settings are located in the DB, so you can customize and add destinations,
+set level restrictions and also charge the player for teleporting.
+
+Installation:
+
+Patch the core with the patch file {date}-TeleNPC2-core.patch
+Patch ScriptDev2 with the patch {date}-TeleNPC2-ScriptDev2.patch
+
+Run the query world_setup_npc_teleport.sql located in the trinity sql directory on
+your world DB. This will setup the DB and you can customize from there.

+What it is:
+===========
+
+Playerbot lets you add another character from your account as a bot that you can control and which will hopefully help you. Only characters from your account can be used, so you can have a maximum of 9 bots at one time.
+
+This was taken from the Trinity site, and modified slightly by me to get some of the kinks out. I reworked the priest class and also added a mage class and a warrior class, which are still in crude form. Any class can be used as a bot - just don't expect much in the way of spells or abilities until someone writes the code for them.
+
+Bots will only use abilities that they have - for example, a priest will only use the renew spell if it has been trained. Also, bot's equipment will lose durability like any other character. So every so often you'll need to log in and repair and train your bot.
+
+For Mangos 7800+
+
+Commands:
+=========
+
+/s .bot add BOTNAME (add character to world)
+/s .bot remove BOTNAME
+/s .bot co|combatorder BOTNAME COMBATORDER [TARGET]
+/invite BOTNAME (bot will auto accept invite)
+/t BOTNAME attack (bot will attack selected target, similar to the way a pet can attack)
+/t BOTNAME follow (orders bot to follow player; will also revive bot if dead or teleport bot if far away)
+/t BOTNAME stay
+/t BOTNAME assist (you'll need to be attacking something and the bot only does melee atm)
+/t BOTNAME spells (replies with all spells known to bot)
+/t BOTNAME cast <SPELLID | (part of) SPELLNAME | SPELLLINK>
+/t BOTNAME use <ITEM LINK>
+/t BOTNAME equip <ITEM LINK>
+/t BOTNAME reset (will reset states, orders and loot list)
+/t BOTNAME report (bot reports all items needed to finish quests)
+/t BOTNAME stats (bot shows available money, free inventory space and estimated item repair costs)
+/t BOTNAME survey (bot shows all available gameobjects, within a local perimeter around the bot)
+/t BOTNAME find <GAMEOBJECT LINK> (bot will travel to the gameobject location and then wait)
+/t BOTNAME get <GAMEOBJECT LINK> (bot will fetch the selected gameobject and then return to the player)
+/t BOTNAME quests (List bot's current quests)
+/t BOTNAME drop <QUESTLINK> (Drop a quest)
+/t BOTNAME orders (Shows bot's combat orders)
+/t BOTNAME pet spells (Shows spells known to bot's pet. Autocast spells will be shown in green)
+/t BOTNAME pet cast <SPELLID | (part of) SPELLNAME | SPELLLINK>
+/t BOTNAME pet toggle <SPELLID | (part of) SPELLNAME | SPELLLINK> (Toggle autocast for a given spell)
+/t BOTNAME pet state (Shows current react mode of bot's pet)
+/t BOTNAME pet react <(a)ggressive | (d)efensive | (p)assive> (Set bot's pet reaction mode)
+
+Shortcuts:
+c = cast
+e = equip
+u = use
+
+Gameobject interaction with bots:
+=================================
+
+  The bot(s) can now interact with gameobjects. This is particularly useful, in order to complete 'gather' type
+  quests (e.g Milly's harvest in Northshire). The bot(s) can also now, harvest 'ore deposits' and 'herbs'
+
+  Three new commands have been introduced 'survey, 'find' & 'get', to facilitate this new feature.
+
+  The 'survey' command provides the means for bot(s) to detect gameobjects in the world. It can be used to detect
+  available gameobjects local to a single bot, or more effectively (wider area) those for a party of bots.
+
+  Suggestion: setup the 'survey' command as an assigned macro button, on the client (e.g /p survey). You can
+  then quickly refresh the gameobject list.
+
+  Gameobject list <GAMEOBJECT LINK> (Currently bots can only interact with ore, herb and needed quest items)
+  ---------------
+
+  [Copper Vein][Silverleaf][Earthroot][Milly's Harvest][Battered Chest][Food Crate]
+
+  Then, use the 'find' or 'get' commands to interect with the gameobject.
+
+  Using the gameobject list information, it is possible to locate and/or fetch each of the gameobjects. To select
+  a <GAMEOBJECT LINK>, hold down the shift key and click on the relevant link with your mouse.
+
+Repair with bots:
+=================
+
+  The bot(s) can now be repaired, as the player repairs. You can decide whether you wish the bot(s) to pay for
+  their own repair or if available, use the guild bank. Choose the appropriate repair 'Anvil' at your local
+  NPC. Only group bot(s) members can be repaired. If you wish to exclude certain bot(s) from repair, then
+  temporarily uninvite bot(s) from the group.
+
+  Limitations: Bot(s) cannot repair individual items.
+               If the player does not require repair, you cannot repair bot(s).
+
+  The new 'stats' command provides useful information to help in the repair decision.
+
+  First:  Money available to bot(s)
+  Second: Free inventory slots for bot(s)
+  Third:  Estimated (excludes NPC reputation discount) item damage cost for bot(s).
+
+Combat Orders explained:
+========================
+
+  There are primary and secondary commands which can be combined. In this way it is
+  possible to define a bot to assist the main tank and also protect the healer, making
+  combat management much easier.
+  The commands assist and protect require a target parameter or a friendly player
+  selected by bots master.
+  Available Combat Orders:
+    tank        pri     try to bind all targets involved in combat by gaining highest threat
+    assist      pri     do damage on selected targets attacker without getting highest threat
+    heal        pri     concentrate on healing - no offensive spells, try to keep threat low
+    protect     sec     if target of protect get's directly attacked gain higher threat on attacker
+    reset       -       clear out assist and protect targets and set combat order to nothing
+  Examples:
+    .bot co TheTank tank
+    .bot co MyHealer heal
+    .bot co TheBrutal assist TheTank
+    .bot co TheBrutal protect MyHealer
+
+Trading with bots:
+==================
+
+To trade items/money with your bot simply initiate a trade and the bot will tell you how much money and items are available. To request an item simple whisper the bot and shift click the link of the item you would like. You can link multiple items on the same line. You can also request money in the following manner when the trade window is open:
+/w BOTNAME 10g <-- request that the bot give you 10 gold
+/w BOTNAME 6g500s25c <-- request 6 gold, 500 silver, and 25 cooper
+
+A bot is also able to show an item in its 'Will not be traded' slot. The item can be either
+in its bags or be equipped and even be soulbound. By this you can cast spells/enchantments
+on soulbound items ('nt' stands for 'not trading').
+/w BOTNAME nt [Powerful Soulbound Item]
+
+More Information:
+=================
+
+If specifying a spell substring, the spell chosen will be in priority of exact name match, highest spell rank, and spell using no reagents. Case does not matter. Here's some examples:
+/t BOTNAME c greater heal
+/t BOTNAME cast pain
+/w BOTNAME c poly
+/w BOTNAME cast fort
+/t BOTNAME cast <SPELLID>
+- OR -
+/w BOTNAME c <SPELLID>
+
+Also all commands can be broadcast to the party. For example:
+/p follow
+/p spells
+
+To use or equip items for your bot say:
+/w BOTNAME use <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>
+/w BOTNAME equip <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>
+- OR -
+/w BOTNAME u <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>
+/w BOTNAME e <ITEMLINK1> <ITEMLINK2>
+
+If you inspect your bot, your bot will tell you what items you have in your inventory that you can equip. To create a link in the chat window, hold the shift key and press the left mouse button when clicking the link.

+
+Changes from Trinity to Mangos:
+===============================
+
+I added the following in SharedDefines.h.
+
+enum SpellCategory
+{
+	SPELL_CATEGORY_FOOD             = 11,
+	SPELL_CATEGORY_DRINK            = 59
+};
+
+I also had to add the following to Player.h:
+
+enum PlayerStateType
+{
+	PLAYER_STATE_NONE              = 0,
+	PLAYER_STATE_SIT               = 1
+};
+
+
+Configuration variables:
+========================
+Also see src/mangosd/mangosd.conf.dist for configuration variables!
+
+    PlayerbotAI.DebugWhisper
+        Enable debug output by whispering master
+        Default: 0 - off
+                 1 - on
+
+    PlayerbotAI.FollowDistanceMin
+    PlayerbotAI.FollowDistanceMax
+        Min. and max. follow distance for bots
+        Default: 0.5 / 1.0
+
+
+Some Problems:
+==============
+
+The bots don't always face in the right direction. Sometimes when a bot makes the kill, the corpse is not lootable. The mage bot sometimes get stuck when he begins to cast a spell (but this is corrected the next time he enters combat).

+What it is:
+===========
+
+The new revised'botguy' utilizes NPCs already distributed throughout the world, to allow players to
+summon and dismiss bots at will, from their own account.
+
+This is a revised (more stable) version that utilizes the new 'GOSSIP MENU SYSTEM' to modify the menus of existing NPCs
+(e.g Trainers etc) to include the bot Recruit/Dismiss menu. (No GameMaster account necessary).
+
+Install (Server administrators only)
+=======
+Please apply 'mangos_botguy.sql' once to the world database to update the 'gossip_menu_option' table.
